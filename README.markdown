# BioGrid #
=======

**Rapid Development Weekend 12 by the Society of Software Engineers**

BioGrid is a fishtank-style game where creatures strive to live in a hostile world. Write JavaScript to
build your very own creature -- the success of your creature depends on the quality of your code.

## Getting Started ##

If you're using Windows, you **should** install Visual Studio so you
can build the native extensions for some Node.js modules.

1.  Install [Node.js][1] (Available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux)
2.  Clone this repository
    1. For OS X and Linux users, move to the repository directory and run `npm install` in your favorite
    shell. This will install any dependencies to the project folder.
    2. For Windows users, reboot your system, open the command prompt, and follow the same as OS X and Linux.

## Running the Program ##
From the command line, run the following to start the server:

    node app -c

To change how the program runs you can go to setup.json. The fields are as follows: 
1.  Number of each creature to be made  
2.  List of all of the creatures locations  
3.  World location  

Go to localhost:3000 in your browser to run the client.
